# Gatsby Portfolio Website

I am integrating my current portfolio with GatsbyJS. Gatsby is a static site generator run with GraphQL and React. I am updating my projects page to use GatsbyJS. Currently, my projects page is built with HTML, CSS, and JS. I want to convert my entire portfolio to GatsbyJS, including the blog!
